# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: ONNX Model Visualizer  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
The ONNX Model Visualizer is a tool designed to load, parse, and display ONNX model architectures in an interactive and user-friendly manner. This tool will help machine learning engineers and researchers understand the structure of their models by providing a clear visualization of the computational graph, including layers, operations, and connections.

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives
- Provide a **graph-based visualization** of ONNX model architectures.
- Support **loading and parsing ONNX models** with a simple interface.
- Display **layer details**, including input/output shapes and operation types.
- Enable **basic interactivity** (zoom, pan, click to inspect layer details).
- Lay the groundwork for future **performance profiling and activation visualization**.

### 1.3 Target Users
- **Machine Learning Engineers**: To inspect and debug model structures.
- **Researchers**: To analyze architectures before deployment.
- **Students & Enthusiasts**: To learn about ONNX models and deep learning frameworks.

## 2. Features & Requirements

### 2.1 Core Features

#### (A) ONNX Model Loading
- Users should be able to **upload an ONNX model file** (`.onnx`).
- The tool should **validate** the model structure and report errors if the file is corrupted.
- Provide metadata about the model (e.g., model name, input shape, output shape).

#### (B) Model Graph Visualization
- Render the model as a **directed computational graph**.
- Nodes should represent **layers/operations** (e.g., Conv, ReLU, BatchNorm, Fully Connected).
- Edges should indicate **data flow** between layers.
- Support **color-coded layers** to differentiate types (e.g., convolutional layers in blue, activation functions in green, etc.).

#### (C) Interactive Graph UI
- **Pan & Zoom**: Allow users to explore large models.
- **Click on a node**: Display layer details (e.g., input/output shape, parameters).
- **Hover over edges**: Show tensor size information.

#### (D) Model Summary Panel
- Display an overview of the model with:
  - Total number of layers and parameters.
  - List of operations used.
  - Input and output dimensions.
  - Model version and framework compatibility.

### 2.2 Future Enhancements (V2 and Beyond)
- **Layer-wise Profiling**: Display inference time per layer.
- **Activation Visualization**: Show activations in real-time.
- **Comparison Mode**: Load and compare two models side by side.
- **Web-based Deployment**: Provide an online interface accessible from a browser.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Backend  | Python (Flask/FastAPI) | virtualenv |
| Model Handling | ONNX, ONNXRuntime |
| Graph Visualization | NetworkX, Graphviz, D3.js |
| Frontend (if applicable) | React.js | Typescript |
| Deployment | Local application or Web app |

### 3.2 Model Parsing Workflow
1. **Load ONNX Model** → Use `onnx.load(model_path)` to parse the model.
2. **Extract Nodes and Edges** → Read `model.graph.node` to build layer connections.
3. **Render Graph** → Use `Graphviz` or `D3.js` to display architecture.
4. **Enable Interactivity** → Implement UI event handling for zoom, pan, and click.

## 4. UI/UX Considerations

### 4.1 User Flow
1. User uploads an ONNX model file.
2. The tool parses and extracts model details.
3. A graph-based visualization is generated.
4. Users interact with the graph (click, hover, zoom, pan).
5. Model summary and metadata are displayed in a separate panel.

### 4.2 Wireframes
- **Main Screen:** Upload model, Display graph, Model summary panel.
- **Graph View:** Interactive visualization of layers.
- **Layer Details Pop-up:** Shows attributes on click.

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Large model sizes may cause slow rendering | Optimize graph rendering, lazy loading for large models |
| Some ONNX models may contain unsupported ops | Implement error handling and warn users |
| Complex UI interactions could be hard to implement | Start with a simple static visualization before adding interactivity |

## 6. Development Roadmap

| Phase | Tasks | Estimated Time |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Phase 1 | Basic ONNX Loading & Parsing | 1-2 Weeks |
| Phase 2 | Graph Visualization (Static) | 2 Weeks |
| Phase 3 | Interactive Graph UI | 3-4 Weeks |
| Phase 4 | Testing & Debugging | 2 Weeks |
| Phase 5 | Release First Version | - |

## 7. Conclusion
The ONNX Model Visualizer aims to simplify the process of inspecting and understanding ONNX models. By starting with **basic architecture visualization**, we create a foundation for future enhancements like **activation profiling** and **performance analysis**. This PRD serves as the blueprint for building the first version, ensuring a structured approach to development.
