## Deployment & Performance Optimization Rules
- Ensure the application is containerized using Docker.
- Use Nginx or another web server for frontend hosting.
- Optimize backend response times for large ONNX models.
- Enable caching for frequently accessed models.
- Implement lazy loading for large model visualizations.
- Deploy on cloud platforms with auto-scaling capabilities.
- Monitor API performance with tools like Prometheus.
- Ensure the frontend is served with gzip compression.
